I am building up a portfolio of my projects. Please help me to improve the code quality, security, performance, and best practices of the following files.
The projects are deployed as Docker containers on a VPS and are exposed to the public internet. Please make sure that the code is production-ready and follows best practices for web applications.
I have a server with limited resources, so please optimize for performance and resource usage.
The code is hosted on GitHub and I use GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Please ensure that the code is compatible with this setup.
Make sure to include also tests where applicable.
Use a .env file for sensitive information and environment variables.
This file contains a variable that lets the app understand if it is in development or production mode.
If applicable, ensure that the code follows accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) and is SEO-friendly.
Please provide specific suggestions and code snippets for improvements, rather than general advice. Focus on practical changes that can be implemented directly in the code.
